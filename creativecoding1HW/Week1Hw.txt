The graphical user interface (GUI) is an interface designed to be used by all users no matter the background in coding. Something like the interface that comes up when the Windows key is pressed on a keyboard it is full of colors and images for ease of use. but the CLI or Command Line Interface is a much simpler interface that allows users to directly interact with the computer without having to search through an interface looking for something you simply type a search command. As mentioned above the main difference is the barrier to entry with the, Graphical user interfaces are normally self-explanatory and designed by a team to be easily recognizable shapes and pictures that anyone would recognize for increased ease of use. Wail the Command Line Interface has a higher bar for entry but can lead you directly to where you want to be without having to spend time looking through icons in a menu or searching through folders. it is simply writing a code line down and with directions to look for of open desired location and the computer will simply bypass everything and take you directly to your desired location. now I can see why this is probably better my critique to the Command Line Interface is that if you don't know what or where the thing you are looking for is then the Graphical user interface will be more helpful.
